# PlanetCreator-UnityAR
Create your own planet and simulate the cosmic!

Enjoy looking at pictures of Earth? Why not try Earf!

- Tap on the screen to generate gorgeous planets
- Move your phone around to view from different angles
- Simulate physics to see them collide!

Under the hood, this app is made with:
- Procedurally generated terrains with multiple noise layers
- A custom shader coloring the planet with random gradients
- Physically (sorta) accurate gravitational force simulations
- Random name generator to give the pet planets names

We do NOT store your data.

We physically can't. We have nowhere to store it. We didn't even set up a server. All gameplay data are stored locally on your phone and won't have any other copies unless you enable iCloud or other methods to back up your phone. So even if Mark Zuckerberg asked nicely to see your data, we wouldn't have anything to show.
